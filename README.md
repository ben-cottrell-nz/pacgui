### pacgui
A GUI for the pacman utility on Arch Linux, utilizing
libalpm.

At the moment, I'm writing test functions to access libalpm v13
functionality. If those test functions prove succesful, they will
be copied into functions that the front-end will call upon.

## Main Features (TODO)
- Searching
- Installing
- Removing
- Reconfiguring
